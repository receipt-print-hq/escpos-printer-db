      Munbyn ITPP047/ITPP102 receipt printer with cutter.

      This printer has all the standard features, but a
      somewhat reduced codepage set. This profile might work
      for other china printers (Meihengtong, ...), too.

      For technical information, go to support.munbyn.com,
      look for "Printer - Drivers / SDK", then download the
      "ITPP047 SDK", which contains the "ITPP047 Program Manual".
